# Advent of Code
My Python solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles.

Advent of Code is an annual Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

To use these scripts, save your input to a local text file named as like "input_day8.txt" or "input_day25.txt", place it in the same folder as the python file, run the script and enjoy the code ðŸŽ‰
